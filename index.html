                I enjoy working both with Front-End and Back-End Development. <br>
                <br>
                Most importantly I would like to work at a company <br>
                where I can use and improve my coding skills. <br>

            <p>
                At least that is what I have been called sometimes. I like to create different kinds of applications and
                solve problems in code. <br>
                I am very goal-oriented and will find ways to make things work. <br>
                I think that it is fun to learn new Frameworks and new methods to do different tasks.

                I would describe myself as a curious learner of anything new. <br>
                I will probably be one of those people who learn new things and skills throughout their lives.
                For me it is important to constantly develop myself into a better and wiser version of myself.

            <p>
                Spring 2022 in my exchange studies I created a brand system system for a company called Stuurmen. The
                idea is that they are able to easily add, modify, view and delete a brand guide. There is a login system
                that let's anyone view the brand guides, but you have to login to get to the dashboard.

            <p>
                The Fitness App will give you workout inspiration by giving access to different workout moves, gives you
                a possibility to keep a journal in it and you can also check your daily, weekly and monthly steps from
                it.
                In the app you can search for movements by bodypart categories or by searching by the targeted area.

                The app is developed with React Native and the workout moves are fetched from an API called ExerciseDB
                on RapidApi.
